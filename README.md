## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Pigfalcon/Pigfalcon** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

I am currently learning SQL, and learning how to use pandas and numpy in Python
I want to learn more about machine learning, but I am strengthening my coding skills first
Overall just learning to be a data scientist.
